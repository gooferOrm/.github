# 🐹 GooferORM

**GooferORM** is a modern, playful ecosystem of tools built on top of [go-prisma](https://github.com/go-prisma/prisma-client-go) — bringing type-safe, schema-first ORM magic to Go developers.  

We’re building a new standard for Go backends: **developer-friendly**, **GraphQL-aware**, and **performance-tuned**.

---

## 🔥 Why GooferORM?

- 🧠 **Type-safe by default** – no `interface{}` spaghetti
- 🧩 **Schema-first** – you define your models once, and it powers everything
- 🚀 **Go-native ergonomics** – no DSLs, no codegen nightmares
- 🕸️ **GraphQL-ready** – clean integration with GraphQL APIs
- 🛠️ **Modular tools** – focused libraries, no bloat
